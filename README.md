# IP-Exercesies
All the exercises I made for IP (Introduction to Programming)
In "Eserciziario" you can find the prompt to all the exercises, with the explanation of what are they and how are they sorted, everything in italian language.
Important note: These are the first coding exercises I made, they are far from being perfect but it's where my University adventure has started, my skill surely has improved well beyond this starting point.
