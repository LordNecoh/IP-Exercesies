# IP-Exercesies
All the exercises I made for IP (Introduction to Programming) </br>
In "Eserciziario" you can find the prompt to all the exercises, with the explanation of what are they and how are they sorted, everything in italian language. </br>
Each folder contains a collection of exercises regarding certain topics, you can see more about each topic in "Eserciziario" </br>
Important note: These are the first coding exercises I made, they are far from being perfect but it's where my University adventure has started, my skill surely has improved well beyond this starting point. </br>
